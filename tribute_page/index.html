          <h2>THE BLACK MAMBA</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Kobe Bean Bryant</b> (August 23, 1978 – January 26, 2020) was an
            American professional basketball player. A shooting guard, he spent
            his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers in the
            National Basketball Association (NBA). Widely regarded as one of the
            greatest basketball players and scorers of all time, Bryant won five
            NBA championships, was an 18-time All-Star, a 15-time member of the
            All-NBA Team, a 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team, the 2008
            NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), and a two-time NBA Finals MVP.
            Bryant also led the NBA in scoring twice, and ranks fourth in league
            all-time regular season and postseason scoring. He was posthumously
            voted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020 and
            named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.

          <h2>Dear Basketball</h2>
          <h3>Dear Basketball,</h3>
          <p>
            From the moment<br />
            I started rolling my dad’s tube socks<br />
            And shooting imaginary<br />
            Game-winning shots<br />
            In the Great Western Forum<br />
            I knew one thing was real:<br />

            I fell in love with you.<br />

            A love so deep I gave you my all —<br />
            From my mind & body<br />
            To my spirit & soul.<br />

            As a six-year-old boy<br />
            Deeply in love with you<br />
            I never saw the end of the tunnel.<br />
            I only saw myself<br />
            Running out of one.<br />

            And so I ran.<br />
            I ran up and down every court<br />
            After every loose ball for you.<br />
            You asked for my hustle<br />
            I gave you my heart<br />
            Because it came with so much more.<br />

            I played through the sweat and hurt<br />
            Not because challenge called me<br />
            But because YOU called me.<br />
            I did everything for YOU<br />
            Because that’s what you do<br />
            When someone makes you feel as<br />
            Alive as you’ve made me feel.<br />

            You gave a six-year-old boy his Laker dream<br />
            And I’ll always love you for it.<br />
            But I can’t love you obsessively for much longer.<br />
            This season is all I have left to give.<br />
            My heart can take the pounding<br />
            My mind can handle the grind<br />
            But my body knows it’s time to say goodbye.<br />

            And that’s OK.<br />
            I’m ready to let you go.<br />
            I want you to know now<br />
            So we both can savor every moment we have left together.<br />
            The good and the bad.<br />
            We have given each other<br />
            All that we have.<br />

            And we both know, no matter what I do next<br />
            I’ll always be that kid<br />
            With the rolled up socks<br />
            Garbage can in the corner<br />
            :05 seconds on the clock<br />
            Ball in my hands.<br />
            5 … 4 … 3 … 2 … 1<br />

            Love you always,<br />
            <b>KOBE</b>

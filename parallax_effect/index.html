      <h2>COFFEE AFICIONADO</h2>
      <p>
        Coffee is a drink prepared from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored,
        bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans,
        primarily due to its caffeine content. It is the most popular hot drink
        in the world. Seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to
        produce unroasted green coffee beans. The beans are roasted and then
        ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water
        before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.

      <h2>BEANS HISTORY</h2>
      <p>
        Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied
        closely to food traditions around the Red Sea. The earliest credible
        evidence of coffee drinking in the form of the modern beverage appears
        in modern-day Yemen from the mid-15th century in Sufi shrines, where
        coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to
        current methods. The Yemenis procured the coffee beans from the
        Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries and began
        cultivation. By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the
        Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe. In the 20th
        century, coffee became a global commodity, creating different coffee
        cultures around the world.

      <h2>COFFEE PREP</h2>
      <p>
        Coffee beans must be ground and brewed to create a beverage. The
        criteria for choosing a method include flavor and economy. Almost all
        methods of preparing coffee require that the beans be ground and then
        mixed with hot water long enough to allow the flavor to emerge but not
        so long as to draw out bitter compounds. The liquid can be consumed
        after the spent grounds are removed. Brewing considerations include the
        fineness of the grind, the way in which the water is used to extract the
        flavor, the ratio of coffee grounds to water (the brew ratio),
        additional flavorings such as sugar, milk, and spices, and the technique
        to be used to separate spent grounds.
